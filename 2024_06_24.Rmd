This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(readr)
df_raw <- read_csv("SYB66_230_202310_GDP and GDP Per Capita.csv", skip=1)
# View(df_raw)

```
```{r}
colnames(df_raw)
```
```{r}
df <- subset(df_raw, select = -c(`Region/Country/Area`, `Footnotes`, `Source`))
names(df) <- c("region", "year", "series", "value")
head(df)
```
```{r}
unique(df$series)
```

```{r}
df <- subset(df, series == "GDP per capita (US dollars)" & year == "2021")
# unique(df$year)
head(df)
```



Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
